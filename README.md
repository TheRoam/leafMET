# leafMET
AEMET data for Leaflet JS

1. Create a basic Leaflet JS map

2. Link the leafMET.js library in your document

3. Call leafMET with reference to your map (see .html example). I.e.:
  - If your map is in a variable called "map"
  `var map=L.map`
  - Call leafMET using:
  `leafMET(map)`
  
  Check the code for further details and see the [demo here](https://theroamingworkshop.cloud/leafMET).
